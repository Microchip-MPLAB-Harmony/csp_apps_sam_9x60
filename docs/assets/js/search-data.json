The loop back test requires the MOSI output pin to be connected to the MISO input pin so that anything transmitted will also be received. The example first transmits 10 bytes and receives 10 bytes. If the received data is same as transmitted then it transmits 0 bytes and receives 10 bytes. In this case, dummy data will be transmitted to receive 10 characters, hence all the received data should be 0xFF. Next, 10 bytes are transmitted and 5 bytes are received. Here, the received bytes must match the first 5 bytes in the transmit buffer. Finally, 5 bytes are transmitted and 10 bytes are received. In this case, the first 5 bytes in the receive buffer must match the first 5 bytes in the transmit buffer. The remaining 5 bytes in the receive buffer must be 0xFF. ",

    "content": "This application configures FLEXCOM0 in non-blocking mode and FLEXCOM4 in blocking mode. FLEXCOM0 is used for data transmission and FLEXCOM4 is used for receiption. The TX line of FLEXCOM0 is connected to the RX line of FLEXCOM4. The RTS line of FLEXCOM4 is connected to the CTS line of FLEXCOM0. FLEXCOM0 transmits 100 characters using interrupts. Application however simulates a slow receiver by inserting a delay after each character is read on FLEXCOM4. As a result, once the RX FIFO is full, the RTS line is de-asserted and transmitter (FLEXCOM0) stops sending the data. Eventually, when the receiver reads out sufficient number of bytes from the RX FIFO, such that the number of bytes in the FIFO goes below RXFTHRES2, the RTS line is again asserted and the transmitter continues sending the data. The demo application indicates success if the received data matches the transmitted data. ",

This require all peripherals and clock leading to the DRAM memory to be configured prior to the application being programmed. This is done using a bootstrap loader. Bootstrap loader project used for this purpose is a variant of the AT91Bootstrap project available for Microchip MPUs. It can be downloaded from here. This project is adapted to be used from within MPLABx IDE on both Windows and Linux. To facilitate the debugging and running of the MPU application, each application in this repository is bundled with its own copy of the AT91Bootstrap project. Each copy of the bootstrap project can be found under same folder as the application project and is named and is prefixed with “at91bootstrap_”. For eg: if the application folder name is sam_9x60_ek.X, then bootstrap project folder will be named at91bootstrap_sam_9x60_ek.X and will be present at the same folder level. Bootstrap project is configured to load and execute a raw binary file named “harmony.bin” from the SD card. SD card slot to be used shall vary with the evaluation kit. Each application project is configured with a post build step which will generate the necessary binary file named “harmony.bin” at the end of each build. If you are only interested in running or debugging the MPU applications in this repository , you can skip the following sections and and jump straight to Debugging MPU application using MPLABx.
