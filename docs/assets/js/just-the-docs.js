This example application uses the RSTC peripheral to indicate the user Reset and the Watchdog reset. The WDT reset is emulated by not feeding the watchdog on switch press. ",

This example also demonstrates cache maintenance operation by cleaning and invalidating cache for the buffers located in cacheable memory. The buffers are aligned to cache line and its size is an integer multiple of the cache line size. Cache line(s) for source buffer range is cleaned before submitting a transfer request to DMA to load the latest data in the cache to the RAM (DDR). Cache line(s) for destination buffer address range is invalidated to ensure that the CPU reads the latest data from the RAM (DDR). ",

This require all peripherals and clock leading to the DRAM memory to be configured prior to the application being programmed. This is done using a bootstrap loader. Bootstrap loader project used for this purpose is a variant of the AT91Bootstrap project available for Microchip MPUs. It can be downloaded from here. This project is adapted to be used from within MPLABx IDE on both Windows and Linux. To facilitate the debugging and running of the MPU application, each application in this repository is bundled with its own copy of the AT91Bootstrap project. Each copy of the bootstrap project can be found under same folder as the application project and is named and is prefixed with “at91bootstrap_”. For eg: if the application folder name is sam_9x60_ek.X, then bootstrap project folder will be named at91bootstrap_sam_9x60_ek.X and will be present at the same folder level. Bootstrap project is configured to load and execute a raw binary file named “harmony.bin” from the SD card. SD card slot to be used shall vary with the evaluation kit. Each application project is configured with a post build step which will generate the necessary binary file named “harmony.bin” at the end of each build. If you are only interested in running or debugging the MPU applications in this repository , you can skip the following sections and and jump straight to Debugging MPU application using MPLABx. Each copy of the bootstrap project in this repository is preconfigured to the correct evaluation kit.Also, the bootstrap binary files required to program and run the applications are checked into the repository.
