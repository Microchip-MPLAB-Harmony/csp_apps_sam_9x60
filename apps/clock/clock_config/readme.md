# Clock configuration

This example application shows how to configure the clock system to run the device at maximum frequency. It also outputs a prescaled clock signal on a GPIO pin for measurement and verification.

## Description

Clock system generates and distributes the clock for the processor and peripherals. This example application shows how to use the clock manager to configure the device to run at the max possible speed. A prescaled clock signal is routed to GPIO pin to measure the frequency and accuracy of the internal device clock.

## Downloading and building the application

To clone or download this application from Github, go to the [main page of this repository](https://github.com/Microchip-MPLAB-Harmony/csp_apps_sam_9x60) and then click Clone button to clone this repository or download as zip file.
This content can also be downloaded using content manager by following these [instructions](https://github.com/Microchip-MPLAB-Harmony/contentmanager/wiki).

Path of the application within the repository is **apps/clock/clock_config/firmware** .

To build the application, refer to the following table and open the project using its IDE.

| Project Name      | Description                                    |

## Setting up AT91Bootstrap loader

To load the application binary onto the target device, we need to use at91bootstrap loader. Refer to the [at91bootstrap loader documentation](../../docs/readme_bootstrap.md) for details on how to configure, build and run bootstrap loader project and use it to bootstrap the application binaries.

## Setting up the hardware

The following table shows the target hardware for the application projects.

| Project Name| Board|
|:---------|:---------:|
| sam_9x60_curiosity.X | [SAM9X60 Curiosity Development Board](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/development-tool/EV40E67A) |

### Setting up [SAM9X60 Curiosity Development Board](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/development-tool/EV40E67A)

#### Setting up the board

- Connect a programming cable from JTAG connector J12 on board to programmer(J-32 Debugger).
- Connect programmer(J-32 Debugger) to computer using a micro USB cable. 
- Connect the USB port J1 on board to the computer using a micro USB cable (to power the board)

## Running the Application

1. Build and Program the application using its IDE.
2. Observe the clock of 500 Hz on clock output pin
3. LED should be turned ON continuously

Refer to the following table for clock output pin and LED name for different boards:

| Board      | Clock output pin | LED Name |
| ---------- | ---------------- |--------- |
|  [SAM9X60 Curiosity Development Board](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/development-tool/EV40E67A) | PD20 (Pin #22 on the J19 Connector) | RGB_LED(Blue) |
