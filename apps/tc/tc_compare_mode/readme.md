# TC compare mode

This example application shows how to use the TC module in compare mode to generate an active low, active high, and toggle output on compare match.

## Description

Three TC channels are configured in compare mode. Each channel generates different output waveform depending upon configured action on compare match and period match.

**Active high output**: Output is set low on compare A match and is set high on compare C match.

### Setting up [SAM9X60 Curiosity Development Board](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/development-tool/EV40E67A)

- Connect a programming cable from JTAG connector J12 on board to programmer(J-32 Debugger).
- Connect programmer(J-32 Debugger) to computer using a micro USB cable. 
- Connect the USB port J1 on board to the computer using a micro USB cable (to power the board).


## Running the Application

1. Build and program the application using its IDE
2. Connect Pin 19(PA22) of J9 connector to oscilloscope and observe an active high output with 100 Hz frequency and 75% duty cycle
