# FLEXCOM SPI EEPROM read write

This example application shows how to use the flexcom module in SPI mode.

## Description

This application configures the flexcom peripheral in SPI mode to read and write data from an external EEPROM memory chip. Data is written to the EEPROM and then read back and compared. Successful comparison is indicated by turning on an LED.

## Downloading and building the application

To clone or download this application from Github, go to the [main page of this repository](https://github.com/Microchip-MPLAB-Harmony/csp_apps_sam_9x60) and then click Clone button to clone this repository or download as zip file.
This content can also be downloaded using content manager by following these [instructions](https://github.com/Microchip-MPLAB-Harmony/contentmanager/wiki).

Path of the application within the repository is **apps/flexcom/flexcom_spi_eeprom/firmware** .

To build the application, refer to the following table and open the project using its IDE.

| Project Name      | Description                                    |

## Setting up AT91Bootstrap loader

To load the application binary onto the target device, we need to use at91bootstrap loader. Refer to the [at91bootstrap loader documentation](../../docs/readme_bootstrap.md) for details on how to configure, build and run bootstrap loader project and use it to bootstrap the application binaries.

## Setting up the hardware

The following table shows the target hardware for the application projects.

| Project Name| Board|

### Setting up [SAM9X60 Curiosity Development Board](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/development-tool/EV40E67A)

#### Addtional hardware required

- [EEPROM 4 Click board](https://www.mikroe.com/eeprom-4-click)

#### Setting up the board

- Connect a programming cable from JTAG connector J12 on board to programmer(J-32 Debugger).
- Connect programmer(J-32 Debugger) to computer using a micro USB cable. 
- Connect the USB port J1 on board to the computer using a micro USB cable (to power the board).
- Insert [EEPROM 4 Click board](https://www.mikroe.com/eeprom-4-click) into MIKROBUS Connector J8


## Running the Application

1. Build and Program the application using its IDE.
4. LED indicates the success or failure:
    - LED is turned ON when the value read from the EEPROM matched with the written value
    - LED is turned OFF when the value read from the EEPROM did not match with the written value

Following table provides the LED name:

| Board      | LED Name                                    |
