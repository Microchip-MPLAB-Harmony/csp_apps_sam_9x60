# RSTC interrupt

This example application shows how to use the RSTC peripheral to generate an interrupt instead of generating a reset, when the Reset switch is pressed on board.

## Description

The RSTC peripheral samples the Reset input (NRST pin) at slow clock speed. When the line is detected low, it resets the processor and the peripherals. However, the RSTC peripheral can be programmed to not trigger a reset when an assertion of NRST occurs. The Reset pin state can be read at any time in software or it can also be programmed to generate an interrupt
instead of generating a reset.

## Setting up the hardware

The following table shows the target hardware for the application projects.

| Project Name| Board|

### Setting up [SAM9X60-EK Evaluation Kit](https://www.microchip.com/developmenttools/ProductDetails/DT100126)

#### Addtional hardware required

- SD Card with FAT32 file system

#### Setting up the SD Card

- Download harmony MPU bootstrap loader from this [location](https://github.com/Microchip-MPLAB-Harmony/at91bootstrap/blob/sam9x60ek/boot.bin)
- Copy the downloaded boot loader binary( boot.bin) onto the SD card

#### Setting up the board

- SDMMC slot used for bootloading the application is SDMMC0 (J4)
- Connect the USB port J22 on board to the computer using a micro USB cable (to enable debug com port)
- Connect the USB port J7 on board to the computer using a micro USB cable (to power the board)
- *NOTE - Reset push button is labelled as SW3*

## Running the Application

1. Build the application using its IDE
2. Copy the output binary (named 'harmony.bin') onto the SD Card (Refer to the 'Setting up hardware' section above for setting up the SD card)
3. Insert the SD card into SDMMC slot on the board (Refer to the 'Setting up hardware' section for the correct SDMMC slot)
4. Disconnect and reconnect the Debug USB port to power cycle the board
5. Press the "RESET" switch and observe the LED toggling
    - *NOTE: push and release RESET switch very quickly so as to not end up cutting power to the PMIC triggering a power on reset (instead of just toggling of the reset pin)*

Refer to the following table for LED name:

| Board      | LED Name                                    |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| [SAM9X60-EK Evaluation Kit](https://www.microchip.com/developmenttools/ProductDetails/DT100126) | RGB_LED toggles between green and blue color for every switch press  |
